## üö® **Upload Error Fixed! Now You Need to Configure Cloudinary**

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret_here

   - **Folder**: `digitroncx-uploads` (optional, for organization)
5. Click **"Save"**

## üìù **Step 4: Update Your .env.local File**

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
# Example (replace with your actual values):

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=digitroncx
```

## üîÑ **Step 5: Restart Your Development Server**

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:

   ```
   Cloudinary upload config: { cloudName: "dpe0etldd", uploadPreset: "digitroncx", ... }
